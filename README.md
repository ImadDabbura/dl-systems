# Deep Learning Systems: Algorithms and Implementation

## Introduction

This course is about implementing a deep learning system that is similar in nature to **Pytorch**. It involves implementing the core underlying algorithms behind deep learning systems such as automatic differentiation and different optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGD) and Adaptive Momentum (Adam).

## Learning Objectives

The main objectives to take this course:
- Build deep learning systems: 
    - Contribute to open-source deep learning frameworks. 
    - Work on developing my own framework for specific tasks. I have been collecting my own implementation of different things in Pytorch such as analyzing gradients of each layer.
- Use existing systems more effectively:
    - Understanding how the internals of existing deep learning systems work let you use them much more efficiently.
    - The only way to understand how things really work is to build it from scratch.
- Understand how operations are carried on both CPU and GPU so I can optimize my customized models/layers to run more efficiently.
